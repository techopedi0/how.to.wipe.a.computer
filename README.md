This wikiHow teaches you how to erase your computer's hard drive. You can perform a simple wipe to remove your installed programs and files by resetting your computer to factory settings, or you can securely erase your computer's hard drive if you need to make data recovery impossible. If you have a Mac that uses a Solid State Drive (SSD), resetting your computer is enough to securely erase the drive.

## Why you should wipe your computer?

How you wipe your PC depends on what you plan to do with it afterward. If you are keeping the computer, you can proceed directly to resetting the hard drive back to a fresh version of Windows. But if you plan to sell or give the computer away, you'll want to take extra precaution to make sure the data stored on your PC is inaccessible to the computer's next owner. 

If you have a hard disk drive (HDD), it will be thoroughly erased when you refresh Windows. But if your computer has a solid-state drive (SSD) — and virtually all computers sold in the last few years do — you'll have to take an extra step to ensure your old data can't be recovered even after it's erased — you should encrypt it.
